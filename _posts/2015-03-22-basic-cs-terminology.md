- `Bit:` smallest unit of binary (0, or 1)
- `Byte:` 8 bits

Binary numbers are expressed in a **base-2 numeral system**.

- 2^0 = ones
- 2^1 = twos
- 2^2 = fours
- 2^3 = eights
- 2^4 = sixteens
- 2^5 = thirty-twos

Using that system, we can calculate the value of these bytes:

<div class="message">
  00000001 -> 1

  00000010 -> 2

  00000011 -> 3

  00001010 -> 10
</div>

Hardware - desktop, tablet, smartphone
Hardware must run programs
Programs need to written in a way that comps understand
Operating System - help all other computer programs work, provides interface between hardware and software

RAM/vrtual memory (temp)
ROM/HD (permanent)

turn on comp - loading stuf from HD to RAM
open application - load into ram, only loads essential stuff first, then loads other things as u request them
when u close an application, it's storage is purged from ram to make new room for other apps

Software is a collection of code & programs that run on your comp
software is soft cuz it can change all the time
application software
system software - OS

Lower Language - Machine Language (no compiler/interpreter), more technical
Higher Language - Python, Ruby, more abstracted, more readable

higher --> lower
perform an operation called COMPILING
compiling - procress of changing somethinfr form higher level to something that machines can understand

Client Server Model
Client makes a request to the server
Server gives content back to the Client

Front-End uses images (html, css, js)

html is a markup language that builds the structure of the website
css styling language that tells the browser how to look

backend (server side languages)

paradigm is the way of doing something
programming paradigm is the way of programming
Procedural - Step by step the procedure we should follwo to solve a specfiic problem (C)
Functional - Look at programs like mathmatematical programs. Received inputs to create an output (racket)
Object-Oriented - uses code objects to mirror real wordl objects (attributes: data asosciate with that object and methods: actions u can perform with the object/attributes)
