A lot of the computer science concepts were never covered during my time at Dev Bootcamp, which was expected. However, I'm still really interested in these basic concepts, and I feel that knowing them will solidify the foundation for my growth in the tech industry. So here is a quick resource sheet I put together to cover some basics.

- `Bit:` smallest unit of binary (0, or 1)
- `Byte:` 8 bits

Binary numbers are expressed in a **base-2 numeral system**.

- 2^0 = ones
- 2^1 = twos
- 2^2 = fours
- 2^3 = eights
- 2^4 = sixteens
- 2^5 = thirty-twos

Using that system, we can calculate the value of these bytes:

* 00000001 -> 1
* 00000010 -> 2
* 00000011 -> 3
* 00001010 -> 10

- `Hardware:` things like a desktop, tablet, smartphone; runs programs
- `Operating System:` a software program that allows the computer hardware to communicate with the computer software
- `RAM`/vrtual memory (temp)
- `ROM`/HD (permanent)

turn on comp - loading stuf from HD to RAM
open application - load into ram, only loads essential stuff first, then loads other things as u request them
when u close an application, it's storage is purged from ram to make new room for other apps

* * *

Software is a collection of code & programs that run on your comp
software is soft cuz it can change all the time
application software
system software - OS

Lower Language - Machine Language (no compiler/interpreter), more technical
Higher Language - Python, Ruby, more abstracted, more readable

higher --> lower
perform an operation called COMPILING
compiling - procress of changing somethinfr form higher level to something that machines can understand

* * *

Client Server Model
Client makes a request to the server
Server gives content back to the Client

Front-End uses images (html, css, js)

html is a markup language that builds the structure of the website
css styling language that tells the browser how to look

backend (server side languages)

* * *

paradigm is the way of doing something
programming paradigm is the way of programming
Procedural - Step by step the procedure we should follwo to solve a specfiic problem (C)
Functional - Look at programs like mathmatematical programs. Received inputs to create an output (racket)
Object-Oriented - uses code objects to mirror real wordl objects (attributes: data asosciate with that object and methods: actions u can perform with the object/attributes)
